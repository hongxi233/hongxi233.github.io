This repository provides an
implementation
 of Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) on auto-regressive transformers (GPU-only). We currently support OpenAI's GPT-2 XL (1.5B) and EleutherAI's GPT-J (6B). The release of a 20B GPT-like model from EleutherAI is expected soon; we hope to support it ASAP.
Feel free to open an issue if you find any problems; we are actively developing this repository and will monitor tickets closely.
